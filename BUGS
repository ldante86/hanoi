The _undo_move() function is bugged in some situations. For example,
in the 3 disc game, the coordinates:
	1 9
	3 2
will trigger _undo_move() without error, but if the command `u' is
used after that, _undo_move() is triggered again. In this instance,
_undo_move() no longer has the last valid coordinates, only the
coordinates of the last invalid position. This causes the largest
disc to disappear, and the game is no longer playable.

I could create a move history function that could be used to reference
any valid coordinate from the start of the game. This would enable the
player to undo as many times as necessary.

_move_history() requirements:
1. history items are stored in an array.
	${history[@]}
2. only valid coordinates are stored.
3. invalid coordinates are skipped.
4. history items are accessed by twos from the end of the array.
	ret1=${history[-2]} # from
	ret2=${history[-1]} # to
5. accessed items are erased after use so new items can replace them.
	unset history[${#history[@]}-1] #remove to
	unset history[${#history[@]}-1] #remove from
