I wrote this game because I've never seen a terminal version of
Towers of Hanoi.

The object of Towers of Hanoi is to reassemble the tower of peg one
over to peg three. A disc can only be placed on top of a larger disc.

The player can choose from 3 to 8 discs. Included is a game solver
that can solve for any number of discs (1-99) -- the length of the
output might never reach its end!

Gameplay might not be intuitive at first. Each tower has a number of
disc spots and the spot numbers are continuous from the top spot of
the first tower to the last spot of the last tower. For example, in a
five disc game:
		  ____++____ __________ __________
  #		  ___++++___ __________ __________               #
		  __++++++__ __________ __________
  #		  _++++++++_ __________ __________	         #
	          ++++++++++ __________ __________  0
  #                    5         10         15                   #

The numbers beneath indicate the lowest spot of each tower. The tip of
tower one is always one. To move the top of tower one to the bottom
spot of tower three, enter coordinates 1 15 at the prompt. Invalid
or conflicting moves will be ignored and will not affect the game. The
number to the right of tower three is the move counter. Each game has
a minimum number of moves for completion.

There are three gameplay commands:
  e	exit the game and clear the screen

  m	abort current game and go back to game menu

  u	undo the last move -- this only works only if the last move
        was a valid move. Undo rolls back the move counter by one;
        undo cannot be used twice in a row.
